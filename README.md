# UrFridge

An application that allows users to keep track of 
what's in their fridge, freezer, or pantry! 
Items can be added to and 
removed from a location, and the Spoonacular API is used
to suggest recipes based on select items the user has 
in their food storage.

Also, it supports multiple 'users' and saves the state of a user's storage in a SQLite database file.
